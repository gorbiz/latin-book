# Latin Book
An interactive book by me, for me, to teach myself Latin.

Potential mergers:
 1. Potential 1st ½ page of book: http://bl.ocks.org/gorbiz/d55ed8c9a7c0c2487a39 ← far from done.
 2. Decenstion explorer: http://codepen.io/gorbiz/pen/eJoJQr ← 0% :art:.

PS.  
Lost in Wikipedia instead of Latin studies?  
**Procrastinate with style** & read **Wikipedia in Latin**: https://gist.github.com/gorbiz/57f1e5aa7cafedc5af9c (rather get encouraged to).
