# Latin Book
An interactive book by me, for me, to teach myself Latin.

Potential mergers:
 1. Potential 1st ½ page of book: http://bl.ocks.org/gorbiz/d55ed8c9a7c0c2487a39 ← far from done.
 2. Decenstion explorer: http://codepen.io/gorbiz/pen/eJoJQr ← 0% :art:.

PS.  
Lost in Wikipedia instead of Latin studies?  
**Procrastinate with style** & read **Wikipedia in Latin**: https://gist.github.com/gorbiz/57f1e5aa7cafedc5af9c (rather get encouraged to).

## Abandoned projects
1. Original aspiration: make a better Rosetta Stone ®. Got [this far](http://bl.ocks.org/gorbiz/3a43ed877c7c1398449e) (most ideas failed to leave my sketchpad & a few in the old [Tamil experiment](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7449985/tamil/.old-demo2.html)s).  
∵ Harder than expected; failed to circumvent grammar hammer(ing) → timeconsuming → falling behind the lectures.

2. Paused lofty ideas; restarted simple with [declension exerciser](http://bl.ocks.org/gorbiz/a46c385c52ae745760b6)... took a lot of time & didn't actually enjoy the exercises / formal :P (Though the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/gorbiz/grammatica-latina/issues) may still contain interesting ideas).
