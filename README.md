# Latin: A Personal Voyage
An interactive book by me, for me, to teach myself Latin.

Here is a [Trello board of ideas](https://trello.com/b/6UgI75QK/latin-a-personal-voyage), you are much welcome to contribute!

## Develop
Clone this repository and ...
1. Make changes to `.jade` & `.styl` files.
2. Run `npm build` (makes them into `.html` & `.css` files).
3. Open / refresh `index.html`

Or simply keep this running in a terminal `npm run watch` (automatically re-builds files on change).

Of course, you shouldn't have to refresh after making changes. A long term (superset) solution in progress: [gorbiz/lucid-dreams#2](https://github.com/gorbiz/lucid-dreams/issues/2)

PS.  
Lost in Wikipedia instead of Latin studies?  
**Procrastinate with style** & read **Wikipedia in Latin**: https://gist.github.com/gorbiz/57f1e5aa7cafedc5af9c (rather get encouraged to).
